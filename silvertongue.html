			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>I teamed up with two other HCDE students in response to the challenge for our user-centered design course: design a conversational interface.</p>

			<p>We were free to select our own domain and design problem, so we decided to see how we could use conversational technology to help college students and recent graduates prepare for job interviews.</p>

			<p>Through a process of user research, prototyping, and usability testing, we designed Silvertongue, a near-future technology featuring a virtual assistant that would enable users to rehearse the interview experience and receive feedback on how to improve their responses.</p>

	<h2>Problem</h2>
		<section class='subsection' id='background'>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
				College students and recent graduates are often applying for full-time positions for the first time. In order to succeed, these individuals need to learn to properly articulate their responses to interview questions, which is a skill that comes through preparation and practice. Although it is possible to rehearse practice interviews with peers or career counselors, the majority of students and recent graduates do not engage in this type of preparation, often due to inconvenience or other barriers.

			<h3>Design Question</h3>
			<p>
				How might we help college students and recent graduates feel more confident in the content and delivery of their responses during interviews?

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p>
		After establishing our problem and design question, we began with user research. We used four different methodologies: surveys, interviews, activity analysis, and competitor analysis.
	</p>

	<p>
		From our data, we constructed 3 personas:
	</p>
	<img src='' alt='' class='center_image'>

	<p>
		After reviewing the pain points, goals, and other information associated with each persona, we agreed on the following primary design requirements:
	</p>

	<p>
		Silvertongue should:
		<ul>
			<li>automatically select interview questions to practice</li>
			<li>provide appropriate feedback to help the user improve</li>
			<li>reduce the barriers to engaging in interview practice</li>
			<li>provide different options based on user preferences</li>
		</ul>
		Detailed design requirements <a href=''>filename</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		Our next step was to sketch some potential solutions:
	</p>

	<p>
	We selected the most promising sketch (based on originality and feasibility) and constructed a paper prototype for our first round of usability testing:
	</p>
	<img src='' alt='' class='center_image'>

	<p>
		This test gave us a huge revelation. Although we implemented voice commands with the intention of making the interface feel conversational, we found that they functioned more like voice-activated buttons instead. Our users were able to complete the tasks, but with more friction compared to a GUI counterpart.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because of this insight, we decided to re-think our idea of conversational interfaces. We returned to the ideation phase and sketched some solutions that relied on a more graphic user interface as a foundation with voice features as supplements when appropriate:

	<p>
		We approved the solution that I sketched out on paper, and began iterating a digital mockup, complete with interactivity via InVision.

	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>
		After testing our digital prototype with 5 participants, we made our final adjustments, resulting in the following version of our prototype:

		We presented our final solution to our class and wrote a design specification document for the imaginary development team:
